# [Spotify for Car](https://spotifyforcar.com/)

Spotify for Car is a web application that allows a group of users to control music from a central output device while utilizing their personal devices.

## Purpose

This app was created and deployed to solve a problem I shared with a small group of friends. I have made the project public in hopes that people could advise me on what I could improve on and provide a resource for people who could learn something from it. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or advice or would just like to chat.
